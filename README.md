# TDA-for-imbalanced-time-series
This project includes code to transform imbalanced time series data to TDA-based outputs, which can be used for various statistical and machine learning purposes.

In this project, we present only two applications but ones can apply to many other cases for imbalanced data in various cases in various fields.
