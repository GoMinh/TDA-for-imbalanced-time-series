# TDA-for-imbalanced-time-series
This project includes code to transform imbalanced time series data to TDA-based outputs, which can be used for various statistical and machine learning purposes.

In this paper, we explore two applications but our TDA-based outcomes can be used in many other cases and in various fields.
